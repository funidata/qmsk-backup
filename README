what:
    rsync-based backups.

scripts:
    rsync-wrapper:
        Provides an rsync wrapper binary (scripts/pvlbackup-rsync-wrapper) intended to be used via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:

            command="/usr/local/bin/pvlbackup-rsync-wrapper --readonly --restrict-path=/foo" ssh-rsa ...

        XXX: the current implementation is not exactly security-audited, the restrictions serve more to avoid mistakes, and do not protect against
             determined misuse of your ssh key..
        
        LVM Snapshots:

            As an additional feature, rsync-wrapper provides support for reading LVM volumes as snapshots:

                rsync -ax foohost:lvm:vg00:lv00 /media/backup/foohost-lv00

            This will transparently create a snapshot, mount it (read-only), and run the server-side rsync from within the mounted snapshot.
